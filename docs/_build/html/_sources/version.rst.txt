Version History
============================

.. note::

   Note: `HAFFET` uses `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_ for its version numbers. Specifically, this means that code written for `HAFFET` v1.0 will continue to work with any v1.x version. However, exact results may differ between versions in the 1.x series. (For example, due to changes in integration method.)
