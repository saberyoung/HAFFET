``ERROR: setuptools 1.0 or later is required by astropy-helpers``
-------------------------------------------------------------------

- reason: when installing astroquery, setuptools version is low

- how to solve::

   >>> import setuptools
   >>> setuptools.__path__

   see where setuptools is called, and then upgrade it: conda install setuptools/pip install setuptools --upgrade/etc
