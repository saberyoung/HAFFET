What is KOBE?
==================
	   
`Key Observing Block Establishment (KOBE) <https://sngyang.com/kobe>`_ is an open source Python package to help develop `observing blocks (OBs) <http://www.not.iac.es/news/reports/stc/49/node32.html>`_ for ground-based astronomical telescopes, aiming to optimize observations in order to efficiently monitor a trigger.

`KOBE` provides utilities to:

* handle and evaluate triggers from multi-messenger channels, e.g. GW, GRB, AMON, etc.
* generate pointing list for telescopes with various of searching strategy.
* coordinate, visualize, and assess the followup search efficiency.
* optimize observing strategy in order to effectively accumulate trigger probability, with inclusion of field visibility and other factors.
* circulate to users/API/webs for a real time search.
